Sisters
Three Sisters companion planting technique

I have a tiny garden area on my patio. Is it enough room to plant the three sisters – corn, beans, and squash – in the spring? Will there be enough corn for it to pollinate? Will there be enough room for the squash to spread? And most important of all, will I feel more connected to the earth and the gift of food if my garden grows well?
